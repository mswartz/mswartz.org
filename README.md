===========

Finally getting going on my personal site. The goal of this site is to have a simple way to collect my things, from random art, to personal achievements, etc. Hopefully this will help me publish stuff, and in that way have a better metric for marking projects as "finished."

#### How it's made
- Jekyll: this seems like a good option for a simple, simple cms
- Upbase: gotta have it.
